Eye opened for a new day again? Well, wish you all a good day.

Most DevOps professional once was a systems administrator. Definitely, not neccessary. I have seen guys jumping from developer field to DevOps.

I started my career as a systems administrator in NELUX TECHNOLOGIES and after 6 months I jumped to the post of "build and release engineer". In AMITI SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGIES I now work as a DevOps support engineer. 

DevOps... is a culture which brings developers and QA to work with an automation engineer to automate day to day tasks. In this culture we uses tools and any one of the programming languages(you can use multiple ) to automate the process from generating the PR to deployment to the servers.

Only difference between a "build and release engineer" and a "DevOps engineer" is automation. And less headaches.

## WHAT SKILLS A DEVOPS ENGINEER NEED?

* Basic Knowledge of systems including kernel, boot process, memory allocation, web server, application servers

* Networking and Infrastucture. This plays a major role for us. Lack of knowledge in this field will lead to payload exposure.

* Basics of database. Not neccessary but learning 2-3 queries can make you pro.

* Good Knowledge in virtualization (for example DOCKER)

* Tools are key to unlock DevOps. For every process we have a focused and efficient softwares available. One example is ansible for CI/CD.

* Programmming languages. Most of the DevOps tools supports PYTHON very well. So make sure you are good at it. 

* For Testing knowing selenium and postman is a plus


DevSecOps and MLOps are yet another branches of DevOps.


## WHAT DEVOPS ENGINEERS DO?

In India most companies from medium scale to large scale maintains the automation codes developed by someone else, mostly on-site teams. I didn't included startups here because there you might need to configure and maintain at the same time. And I loves that. I love configuring systems and thats what my passion is.

So as a daily task we need to observe the work flows from PR generation --> build --> deployment. And troubleshooting the errors which occurs in these steps.

Also we use python for sending automating mails, getting details from API, deploying and scaling and much more. Finally we can say DevOps is the junction where all processes meets.

NOTE: This is what DevOps does in a web development company. If its a product based or ML/AI supporting company you have to involve in configuring stuffs too.


HAPPY HELMING!!!
