Whoo hoo! Thanks for visiting again. :tada:

Lets design an on-demand github hosted runner this time. You know.. nowadays CI/CD are shifting to GHA from jenkins. Yeah I know GHA is still not matured enough to tackle jenkins. But it has a speacial advantage over jenkins. AUTOMATION. Automation becomes smoother with GHA. The topic..

Self Hosted Runners. 

In my organisation we still don't have an on-demand github self hosted runner. I think most of the companies are running self hosted runners in k8s to avoid expense and to get high performance. I love it. Question is are we saving resources too? Definitely not hard to say. Nope. ðŸ˜¶. Does resource matter in k8s ðŸ¤£ ? Yes.

Here is a basic design for GH runners to run ON-DEMAND. 

![](/images/runner_design.png)

###### ðŸ§£THE FLOWðŸ§£

**Box 1**: Setup the github repository webhook (see MISC section if you never configured one)

**Box 2**: We need a k8s operator which can control the api-server we created. 

**Box 3**: Api-server should be capable of receiving payload and create a k8s job to spin up a github runner pod and once done shut it down.

**Box 4**: Running k8s pod github runner.




###### ðŸ“Œ MISCðŸ“Œ 

ðŸŽƒ How to setup webhook?

Configure the repository to send json payload when a workflow event is triggered.

![](/images/webhook.png)

- Provide the k8s application URL we configured in `Payload URL`

-  `Content-type` application/json

- `Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?` section select `Let me select individual events` --> `workflow jobs and runs` and save.


ðŸŽƒ An example code snippet of api server (need to add more functionalities)
```
# Code
package main

import (
    "log"
    "net/http"
    "io/ioutil"
    "github.com/tidwall/gjson"
)

func test(rw http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
    body, err := ioutil.ReadAll(req.Body)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    log.Println(string(body))
    value := gjson.Get(string(body), "repository.full_name")
    log.Println(value.String())
}

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/test", test)
    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8082", nil))
}
```

ðŸŽƒ Build a container image, `go build` can help you on this or use below ones

```
# DockerFile
FROM --platform=$BUILDPLATFORM golang:1.20-alpine AS build-env
COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app
ARG TARGETOS
ARG TARGETARCH
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=${TARGETOS} GOARCH=${TARGETARCH} \
    go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o myapp main.go

# Create image
FROM scratch
COPY --from=build-env /app /
ENTRYPOINT ["/myapp"]
```

then build it `docker build --build-arg GITHUB_TOKEN=<token> --build-arg RUNNER_VERSION=<runner version without v suffix> --build-arg RUNNER_GROUP=<runner group name> -t <image name> .`

ðŸŽƒ If you want to deploy in k8s
