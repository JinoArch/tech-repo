Hope you all are having a good day.

I tried an very interesting testing tool today. Testkube. what should I call it? ðŸ˜„ Hmm... A testing orcherstrator which runs in k8s. Yes thats what it is. A centralised place where all your exisiting testing tool meets. 

Bringing all testing tools to one place brings more visibilty and All the test runs on k8s so no usual CI/CD dependencies. What I loved was the setup. As you know everything is operator nowadays - All CRDs (custom resource definition)

*** Work in progress.. 1..2...3.... ***
