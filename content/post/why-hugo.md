Since my BTech course completion I was thinking to make a blog site. 2018 - College life ends, Blog life starts ðŸ¤ª. 

Good Fun years are all done.. Its time to walk towards my dream.

Oh! I am moving away from my title. So lets talk about HUGO.

I searched a lot for blog creation and was disappointed until I found HUGO. 

Mostly I uses [duckduckgo](https://duckduckgo.com/) and [ecosia](https://www.ecosia.org/?c=en) as my searchengines. I love them both. So while searching I came across 2 static site generators one is "Jekyll" written in Ruby and "Hugo" written in Go. Frankly saying I don't know both languages. And decided to use HUGO. 

I know only basics of C and Java. And is an intermidiate player in "PYTHON". 

There are lot more helpful links available inside INTRANET which helps to create one. I just went through one of the links and damn!! it was so easy to make a project and push the contents. We can commit it to github and I no more need to save contents in my machine.. Awesome! right? 

I don't like saving contents in my PC/mobile even if it is a mp3 or mp4 .... I pulls all online.

And from [github](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/) I can link it to my domain. Thats it. No more headaches. You can even link your [custom domain](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages).

After working around all these things next I searched was a simple and efficient theme... and you will not believe hugo has a bulk of [themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/) as templates. 

Most importantly, hugo supports json and yaml config file. And as a devops engineer and python programmer I love both json and yaml. Yet another advantage was [markdown file](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)

Recommending all to try hugo once. Its really awesome.
