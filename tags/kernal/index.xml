      <description>Bonsoir!
I was going through some of my kernel docs today and suddenly gotta mood to write on the same. If I speak in simple language, what is kernel? It is nothing but a set of code which knows how to communicate with hardwares. Linux is mostly written in C with a bit of assembly language. Actually this kernel code understands how to interpret your keypresses when you press a key and/or how to communicate with your hard drive to write bytes to it and much more.</description>
