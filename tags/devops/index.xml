      <description>Eye opened for a new day again? Well, wish you all a good day.
Most DevOps professional once was a systems administrator. Definitely, not neccessary. I have seen guys jumping from developer field to DevOps.
I started my career as a systems administrator in NELUX TECHNOLOGIES and after 6 months I jumped to the post of &amp;ldquo;build and release engineer&amp;rdquo;. In AMITI SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGIES I now work as a DevOps support engineer.</description>
