      <description>Whoo hoo! Thanks for visiting again. ðŸŽ‰
Lets design an on-demand github hosted runner this time. You know.. nowadays CI/CD are shifting to GHA from jenkins. Yeah I know GHA is still not matured enough to tackle jenkins. But it has a speacial advantage over jenkins. AUTOMATION. Automation becomes smoother with GHA. The topic..
Self Hosted Runners.
In my organisation we still don&amp;rsquo;t have an on-demand github self hosted runner. I think most of the companies are running self hosted runners in k8s to avoid expense and to get high performance.</description>

      <description>Eye opened for a new day again? Well, wish you all a good day.
Most DevOps professional once was a systems administrator. Definitely, not neccessary. I have seen guys jumping from developer field to DevOps.
I started my career as a systems administrator in NELUX TECHNOLOGIES and after 6 months I jumped to the post of &amp;ldquo;build and release engineer&amp;rdquo;. In AMITI SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGIES I now work as a DevOps support engineer.</description>
