      <description>Whoo hoo! Thanks for visiting again. ðŸŽ‰
Lets design an on-demand github hosted runner this time. You know.. nowadays CI/CD are shifting to GHA from jenkins. Yeah I know GHA is still not matured enough to tackle jenkins. But it has a speacial advantage over jenkins. AUTOMATION. Automation becomes smoother with GHA. The topic..
Self Hosted Runners.
In my organisation we still don&amp;rsquo;t have an on-demand github self hosted runner. I think most of the companies are running self hosted runners in k8s to avoid expense and to get high performance.</description>

      <description>Hope you all are having a good day.
I tried an very interesting testing tool today. Testkube. what should I call it? ðŸ˜„ Hmm&amp;hellip; A testing orcherstrator which runs in k8s. Yes thats what it is. A centralised place where all your exisiting testing tool meets.
Bringing all testing tools to one place brings more visibilty and All the test runs on k8s so no usual CI/CD dependencies. What I loved was the setup.</description>

      <description>Bonsoir!
I was going through some of my kernel docs today and suddenly gotta mood to write on the same. If I speak in simple language, what is kernel? It is nothing but a set of code which knows how to communicate with hardwares. Linux is mostly written in C with a bit of assembly language. Actually this kernel code understands how to interpret your keypresses when you press a key and/or how to communicate with your hard drive to write bytes to it and much more.</description>

      <description>Eye opened for a new day again? Well, wish you all a good day.
Most DevOps professional once was a systems administrator. Definitely, not neccessary. I have seen guys jumping from developer field to DevOps.
I started my career as a systems administrator in NELUX TECHNOLOGIES and after 6 months I jumped to the post of &amp;ldquo;build and release engineer&amp;rdquo;. In AMITI SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGIES I now work as a DevOps support engineer.</description>

      <description>Since my BTech course completion I was thinking to make a blog site. 2018 - College life ends, Blog life starts ðŸ¤ª.
Good Fun years are all done.. Its time to walk towards my dream.
Oh! I am moving away from my title. So lets talk about HUGO.
I searched a lot for blog creation and was disappointed until I found HUGO.
Mostly I uses duckduckgo and ecosia as my searchengines.</description>
