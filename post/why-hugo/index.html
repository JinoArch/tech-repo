        <article>
            <p>Since my BTech course completion I was thinking to make a blog site. 2018 - College life ends, Blog life starts ðŸ¤ª.</p>
<p>Good Fun years are all done.. Its time to walk towards my dream.</p>
<p>Oh! I am moving away from my title. So lets talk about HUGO.</p>
<p>I searched a lot for blog creation and was disappointed until I found HUGO.</p>
<p>Mostly I uses <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">duckduckgo</a> and <a href="https://www.ecosia.org/?c=en">ecosia</a> as my searchengines. I love them both. So while searching I came across 2 static site generators one is &ldquo;Jekyll&rdquo; written in Ruby and &ldquo;Hugo&rdquo; written in Go. Frankly saying I don&rsquo;t know both languages. And decided to use HUGO.</p>
<p>I know only basics of C and Java. And is an intermidiate player in &ldquo;PYTHON&rdquo;.</p>
<p>There are lot more helpful links available inside INTRANET which helps to create one. I just went through one of the links and damn!! it was so easy to make a project and push the contents. We can commit it to github and I no more need to save contents in my machine.. Awesome! right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like saving contents in my PC/mobile even if it is a mp3 or mp4 &hellip;. I pulls all online.</p>
<p>And from <a href="https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/">github</a> I can link it to my domain. Thats it. No more headaches. You can even link your <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages">custom domain</a>.</p>
<p>After working around all these things next I searched was a simple and efficient theme&hellip; and you will not believe hugo has a bulk of <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/">themes</a> as templates.</p>
<p>Most importantly, hugo supports json and yaml config file. And as a devops engineer and python programmer I love both json and yaml. Yet another advantage was <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/">markdown file</a></p>
<p>Recommending all to try hugo once. Its really awesome.</p>
